# Hi there!

My name is Jen, and I am a student developer located in Madison, Wisconsin. I am currently an intern at Singlewire Software, and I have worked for UW Madison's Division of Information Technology. Through these, I have development experience in ReactJS, NodeJS/ExpressJS, and Clojure. I'm also a student at Madison College where I'm enrolled in an associates program studying software development. My coursework is in full-stack development using PHP and Java on the back-end, JavaScript (vanilla & AngularJS) on the front-end. I'm especially interested in full-stack work, as well as accessibility/ux!
