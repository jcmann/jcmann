# Hi there!

My name is Jen, and I am a student developer located in Madison, Wisconsin. I currently work for UW Madison's Division of Information Technology, where I work with React, SQL, WordPress, and Selenium IDE for testing. I'm also a student at Madison College where I'm enrolled in an associates program studying software development. My coursework is in LAMP stack development with Java and JavaScript. I'm especially interested in full-stack work, as well as accessibility/ux.
